# RecordTheBeat
RecordTheBeat, a WIP program that records a video from an osu replay. Written in .NET Core.

# How does it work?
RecordTheBeat works by processing the osu! files required (database file, replay file, and beatmap file), and creating a video based on that information by drawing it frame by frame, and stitching it together using FFmpeg.
